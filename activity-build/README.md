# Build tool for Discord Activities in Rust

## Update @discord/embedded-app-sdk

This build tool embeds the official [@discord/embedded-app-sdk](https://github.com/discord/embedded-app-sdk), so it's necessary to update it when there are changes.

This requires Node and Esbuild to be installed.

```shell
./update.sh
```
